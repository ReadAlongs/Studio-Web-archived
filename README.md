> Web application for audiobook alignment for Indigenous languages!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4. This web application is a web interface for end-to-end audio/text aligner. It is meant to be used together with the API from [ReadAlong-Studio](https://github.com/readalongs/Studio) to assemble the text required for alignment.

## Background

This web application is intended to be a graphical version of the [ReadAlong Studio command line interface](https://github.com/ReadAlongs/Studio) for creating interactive "read-alongs".

### Data Sovereignty

We have built the tool with Indigenous data sovereignty in mind ([see here for more info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fodGN4kaEcI)). As such, we are using the JavaScript version of [soundswallower](https://github.com/ReadAlongs/SoundSwallower) which runs on the users' computer without uploading audio to a server. Text data will be sent (encrypted) to the ReadAlongs API but is not stored or saved to disk on the server and is only used for creating the ReadAlong.

## Installing

You must have Node installed (v16 preferred), then run `npm install` from the repo root.

## Usage

### Development

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To see the French version you may run `ng serve --configuration=fr`. Other translations are always welcome!

The ReadAlongs/Studio web API must also be running locally on port 8000 for the app to work in dev mode: clone https://github.com/ReadAlongs/Studio.git, cd into `Studio/readalongs` and launch the web API with `PRODUCTION= uvicorn readalongs.web_api:web_api_app --reload` (see `Studio/readalongs/web_api.py` for details).

### Production

Run `npm run-script build:prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Northeastern University collaboration

The design of the interface and CSS styling was developed by two group of students in Michael Running Wolf's Spring 2022 Foundations of Software Engineering course.
